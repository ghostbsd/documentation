Documentation Contribution
==========================

Writing documentation is a great way to start improving GhostBSD user experience and you will be helping a lot of GhostBSD users to better understand their desktop and applications. Anyone with reasonable English skills and good knowledge of FreeBSD, GhostBSD or MATE can help.

## Communicating with the team

There are many ways to get in touch with the team:
* [GhostBSD Dev](https://t.me/ghostbsd_dev) Group on Telegram
* [#ghostbsd-dev:libera.chat](https://app.element.io/#/room/#ghostbsd-dev:libera.chat) channel on Matrix
* #ghostbsd-dev on the Libera Chat IRC.

Those three messaging platform are connected together. So whatever you use IRC, Telegram or Matrix you will be connected to all the messaging platform.

## Getting the resources

In order to document GhostBSD projects, you will want to run a [recent GhostBSD build](https://www.ghostbsd.org/download#latest_builds), and to document third-party projects, you will also need a recent version of that program. We are use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) with [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io) to makes it easy to create our Documentation Hub. Any one that wants to help should start to be familiar with [Git](getting-started/getting-started.md#knowing-how-to-use-git), [GitHub](getting-started/getting-started.md#knowing-how-to-use-github) and [MyST Markdown syntax](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html).

The instructions for install and setup can be found on the  [GhostBSD Documentation GitHub](https://github.com/ghostbsd/documentation#local-development-server) repository.

## Tasks

You can get your first contribution committed today! Here are some tasks for the beginner:
* Read the documentation if there is a grammar issue, fix it
* Improve the sentences and paragraphs
* Update ScreenShots and Documentation
* Create issues on our  [GitHub Documentation Issues](https://github.com/ghostbsd/documentation/issues/new).

There are also tasks and issues that can be found at our [Documentation Management](https://github.com/orgs/ghostbsd/projects/5) on GitHub.

If you see any article from the [Wiki](https://wiki.ghostbsd.org/) that could be ported communicate the effort with the others in the GhostBSD dev chat.
